"Asterisk: forcejitterbuffer. Forces the use of a jitterbuffer on the receive "

"receiving a jittery channel but sending it off to another channel such as a "
"SIP channel to an endpoint, since there is typically a jitter buffer at the "
"far end. This will force the use of the jitter buffer before sending the "
