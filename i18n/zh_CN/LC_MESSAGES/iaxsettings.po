"Asterisk: forcejitterbuffer. Forces the use of a jitterbuffer on the receive "
"side of an IAX channel. Normally the jitter buffer will not be used if "
"receiving a jittery channel but sending it off to another channel such as a "
"SIP channel to an endpoint, since there is typically a jitter buffer at the "
"far end. This will force the use of the jitter buffer before sending the "
"stream on. This is not typically desired as it adds additional latency into "
"the stream."

"Asterisk: jitterbuffer. You can adjust several parameters relating to the "
